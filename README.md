# DeFi Arena: Battle for Yield üçÄ‚öîÔ∏è

DeFi Arena is an exhilarating Player vs. Player (PvP) game that redefines competitive gaming by allowing players to wager real yield-bearing assets. Powered by **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**, this innovative platform transforms the gaming experience into a secure and confidential battleground. Players can use their assets from protocols like Aave and Compound as stakes in thrilling 1v1 duels where every match is encrypted, ensuring fair play and privacy.

## The Problem üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

In the fast-paced world of decentralized finance (DeFi), while players enjoy the thrill of gaming, they often face the risk of losing their hard-earned assets. Competitive gaming typically lacks privacy, exposing players to potential exploits and unfair advantages. Moreover, integrating DeFi assets into games without jeopardizing security and confidentiality remains a significant challenge. 

## How FHE Solves This Issue üîê

At the heart of DeFi Arena lies Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology, which allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without needing to decrypt it first. This means that while players engage in combat, their assets remain entirely private and secure. Using Zama‚Äôs open-source libraries‚Äîsuch as **Concrete**, **TFHE-rs**, and the **zama-fhe SDK**‚Äîwe have crafted a competitive gaming environment where users can confidently wager their yield-bearing assets without fear of exploitation. Players can focus on strategy and skill rather than worrying about the safety of their funds.

## Key Features üåü

- **Yield Asset Wagering**: Players can stake their yield-bearing assets, like aTokens, during matches.
- **Encrypted Match Logic**: The decision-making process and outcomes of battles are securely encrypted, ensuring fairness.
- **Asset Security During Games**: Winners claim their opponent's assets without losing any accrued interest during the match.
- **Integration with DeFi Protocols**: Seamless connections to platforms like Aave and Compound for a smooth user experience.
- **Futuristic Aesthetic**: Enjoy a visually appealing environment inspired by esports and cyberpunk themes.

```

## Installation Guide üöÄ

To set up DeFi Arena on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Dependencies**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can verify this by running:
   ```bash
   node -v
   ```

2. **Setup Hardhat**: Install Hardhat globally if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   npm install --global hardhat
   ```

3. **Clone the Repository**: Instead of cloning, download the project files directly from the source.

4. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate into the project directory and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This command will fetch all necessary dependencies, including the Zama FHE libraries.

## Build & Run Guide üéÆ

With the setup complete, you can build and run the DeFi Arena project using the following commands:

1. **Compile the Smart Contracts**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run Tests**: Ensure everything is functioning correctly:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**: To launch the game interface:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to access the game through your browser.

## Example: Wager a Match ‚öîÔ∏è

Here's a quick glance at how you might implement a function to initiate a match wager using Solidity:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./DeFi_Arena.sol";

contract MatchManager {
    function wagerMatch(address opponent, uint256 stakeAmount) public {
        // Logic to ensure both participants agree on the wager
        // Use FHE for handling stakes securely
        require(isValidOpponent(opponent), "Invalid opponent!");
        require(stakeAmount > 0, "Stake must be greater than zero!");

        // Further logic to initiate the match...
    }
}
```

With this implementation, users can engage in wagering matches confidently, knowing that their stakes are protected by the power of FHE.
